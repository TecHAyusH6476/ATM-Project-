# ATM-Project-

Its a simple terminal based ATM project where users can manage their bank account. 
I have created this project to understand more about how Java works as well as to study and practice the concepts of oops. 
Control statements, functions, OOPs concepts, conditionals, and loops were among the new concepts learned and practiced while working on the project.
